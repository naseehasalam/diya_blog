        <h1>The Scope of Judicial Review - Basic Structure Doctrine</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my 3-part explainer on the scope of judicial review to contemporary issues. The issue we would be discussing today is the scope of judicial review in contemporary times. Does the scope of judicial review only apply to constitutional amendments or can it be brough paraellel into legidlations and executive orders? This is a topic that has been frequently litigated upon and the core of the issue lies in this basic principle: There is no set limit or horizons to what one can safely call; the basic structure doctrine. </p>

        <h2>Defining the scope of the Basic Structure Doctrine</h2>
        <p>The Basic Structure of the Constitution refers to the foundational principles and essential features that form the core of a constitution and cannot be altered or amended by the legislature. The concept of the Basic Structure Doctrine was established by the Supreme Court of India in the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973). According to the Kesavananda Bharati case judgment, the Supreme Court held that certain fundamental principles and values are inherent in the Constitution that cannot be abrogated or violated by any constitutional amendment.

According to the Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution, any amendment that seeks to alter the constitution’s fundamental design shall be regarded as unconstitutional and invalid. The fundamental principles are considered essential for maintaining the democratic, republican, and secular character of the Indian Constitution.</p>
        <h2>Evolution of BSD</h2>
        <p>The Doctrine of Basic Structure has evolved through several key judicial pronouncements and landmark cases in the Indian legal system. Here is a brief overview of the evolution of the Basic Structure Doctrine:
           <ul>
            <li>Shankari Prasad Case</li>
            <li>Sajjan Singh Case</li>
            <li>Golak Nath Case</li>
            <li>Kesavananda Bharati Case</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Application to Contemporary Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The significance of the Basic Structure Doctrine is immense. These pointers have been briefly discussed below;
            <ul>
                <li>The basic structure of Constitution provides a basis that no one can harm the core principles of the Indian Constitution by force or majority.
                </li>It helps preserve the fundamental concept of Indian democracy; otherwise, unrestricted parliamentary power may have transformed India into a totalitarian state.</li>
                <li>It is beneficial and crucial to retaining the fundamental and core principles of the constitution that was crafted diligently by our founding fathers.</li>
                <li>By clearly defining a real division of powers in which the judiciary is autonomous, free of any interference from the other two organs, it improves our democracy. Additionally, it has greatly increased the Supreme Court’s power, making it the most dominant court in the world.</li>
            </ul>       
        </p>
